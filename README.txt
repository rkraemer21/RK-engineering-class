This repository is where I've kept all my work in coding for my engineering and AP Computer Science classes.  Thus, it shows basically everything I've done, from the messy beginnings to the more polished steps of learning.  For example, in the LearningPythonTheHardWay folder, you'll see everything from the first exercise where I didn't know what "print" was, to the last.  The same goes for the APCS folder â€” I'm still implementing my knowledge of classes and better organization, but I am surely learning. When I organized this to show to the world, I kept all of the messy beginnings. 

DIRECTORIES:
-Highlights: this contains some of the projects I am most proud of.

-AdvOC_Python: this is for Advent of Code challenges done in Python.

-APCS_Java: this is for my APCS class where I learn Java.  It is mostly Advent of Code challenges. The files are a bit messy because Java is not well geared towards those sorts of problems, but I've figured it out.

-LearningPythonTheHardWay: these are files that I made as I went through the book LPtHW, and they represent my development in Python over time.

-Game: this is an unfinished game I started in Python, called "rafico".  It's a text adventure, and if you want you can play it by running it with python3 on your computer's console or terminal.

-Tools: these are files that do useful things like copy other files.

-Euler Problems: this is a small folder of attempts I've made at solving Euler Problems with Python. Not all are finished.

-Tests: this is for test files I've made to figure out a simple principle.
