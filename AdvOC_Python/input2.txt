The Benilde-St. Margaret’s History club is designed for the furthering of individual and group interest in the history of our country and world. This club will meet every other week for small groups to give presentations on a history topic of their choice and interest. These presentations are required by every member and any who do not participate will not be considered members. In order to be considered a member, a student must attend half of all meetings a year. 
In order for students to earn the tassel of the National History Scholars Society a student must keep a 3.5 average GPA in Social Studies classes and a 3.3 cumulative GPA average. Members must take at least one AP Social Studies/History course. Those that are awarded membership in the NHSS will be allowed to wear burgundy tassels upon their graduation.
In the BSM History Club there are four elected offices that may be filled by Juniors or Seniors. The offices are as follows: President, Vice-President, Secretary and Historian. The President will be responsible for the overseeing of the club in general, including scheduling meetings and running them. The Vice-President will act as the President’s aide and will be responsible for recruitment and publicity (putting in announcements, setting up posters etc.). The Secretary will be responsible for taking notes on every meeting that takes place, as to provide a record for what transpired and for the review of the club adviser. The Historian of the club is intended to be a student generally proficient in History, will give the first presentation of the year, and will be responsible for organizing and scheduling all out of school activities. These positions will be voted on, and only open for all members in good standing, at the final meeting of the year, voting for the next year, meaning only Sophomores and Juniors will be eligible to run.
